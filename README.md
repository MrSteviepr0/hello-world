# hello-world

Hi and Greetings fellow patrons!

My name is Stevie and I have aims and hopes to achieve a professional status within this industry of Computer Science,Software Development and Software Engineering.
I am a current full-time student at C.T.U. Online, and I believe this platform is awesome.
That being the case I look foward to meeting experienced and even beginers like myself with the idea of learning and helping each other in this pursuit.
